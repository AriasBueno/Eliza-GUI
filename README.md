# Eliza-GUI
This GUI takes in sentences and finds the longest word in each sentence the user types. It stores each sentence in a file, and stores each long word in an array. Once the user clicks the "Done" button, it tells the user the name of the file where all of their sentences are stored, and displays each sentence in a text area. If the user clicks on the "Request Longest Words" button, it the longest word in each of the user's sentences.
